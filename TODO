This module was thrown together...sorry. i

1) Improve code and pod.
2) Modify out_file() so it's not tied to puz2text().
Considers all but one single letter as a word, which apparently
doesn't conform to US Crossword rules (are there non-US rules?).
3) Have a "strict" function that requires conformity to set of rules?
