NAME
    Convert::AcrossLite - Convert binary AcrossLite puzzle files to text.

SYNOPSIS
    use Convert::AcrossLite;

    my $ac = Convert::AcrossLite->new();
    $ac->in_file('/home/doug/puzzles/Easy.puz');
    $ac->out_file('/home/doug/puzzles/Easy.txt');
    $ac->puz2text;

    or

    use Convert::AcrossLite;

    my $ac = Convert::AcrossLite->new();
    $ac->in_file('/home/doug/puzzles/Easy.puz');
    my $text = $ac->puz2text;

DESCRIPTION
    Convert::AcrossLite is used to convert binary AcrossLite puzzle files 
    to text.

    Convert::AcrossLite is loosely based on the C program written by Bob 
    Newell (http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/gene/AcrossLite).

CONSTRUCTOR
  new

    This is the contructor. You can pass the full path to the puzzle file.

      my $ac = Convert::AcrossLite->new(file => '/home/doug/puzzles/Easy.puz');

    The default value is 'Default.puz'.

METHODS
  in_file

    This method returns the current puzzle input path/filename. 

      my $in_filename = $ac->in_file;

    You may also set the puzzle input file by passing the path/filename.

      $ac->in_file('/home/doug/puzzles/Easy.puz');

  out _file

    This method returns the current puzzle output path/filename. 

      my $out_filename = $ac->out_file;

    You may also set the puzzle output file by passing the path/filename.

      $ac->out_file('/home/doug/puzzles/Easy.txt');

  puz2text

    This method will produce a basic text file in the same format as the 
    easy.txt file provided with AcrossLite. This method will read the
    input file set by in_file and write to the file set by out_file.

      $ac->puz2text;

    If out_file is not set, then the text is returned.

      my $text = $ac->puz2text;

      or
 
      print $ac->puz2text;

  _parse_file

    This helper method does the actual parsing of the puz file.
